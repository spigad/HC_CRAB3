	* Updated ChainGroupHandling so that it wouldn't print an
	  error message when somebody creates a ChainGroup before
	  the first file is opened.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-07

2011-11-25 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Using functions on a ChainGroup now makes sure that
	  the correct configuration is loaded when the ChainGroup
	  functions are evaluated. (Prescales could be wrong in
	  the past...)
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-06

2011-11-21 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a parameter to GetConfigSvc(...) which can disable the
	  auto-loading of the configuration for the current event.
	  (When you define a new configuration tree after you opened
	  a new file, you don't want the tool trying to access a
	  non-existent tree in memory.)
	* Made the functions in IDataAccess public, as these can be
	  useful in many situations. (One couldn't use the enumeration
	  defined in this class before this.)
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-05

2011-11-21 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the code such that when the user calls the
	  GetConfigSvc() function on the TDT, it would always be
	  ensured to be in the correct state for the current
	  event. (So far the higher level functions made sure
	  one by one that the correct configuration is loaded.)
	* Added some documentation for Doxygen.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-04

2011-10-31 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a new suite of functions for listing all the triggers
	  from an event, or from a chain group that passed in the
	  current event. This should help in some interactive
	  analyses, or analyses running on just a few events.
	* TrigConfigSvcD3PD can now look up LVL1 items and HLT chains
	  based on their CTP/Chain Id.
	* Added some extra protection against failures in some places.
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-03

2011-09-28 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Small fix for RootCore compilation on MacOS X Lion.
	  (libTree is somehow not loaded by default under ROOT
	  5.30.01 there...)
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-02

2011-09-05 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created this new package based on the ROOT-only sources
	  that were in the TriggerD3PDMaker package so far.
	* The code can be compiled in 3 ways at the moment:
	  - In the Athena environment like any other CMT package
	  - Using RootCore
	  - Using a completely standalone Makefile
	* Tagging as TrigRootAnalysis-00-00-01
